Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a software development project that aimed to design and implement a system to manage a driver training and assessment program. DriverPass is the client, more specifically Liam - the owner. The system was designed to assist with driver training, assessments, and certification.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I demonstrated strong technical skills in designing and implementing the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have to say the diagrams. I'm not particularly great at making them and definitely could use the practice to improve.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Through interviews and surveys with end-users to understand pain points and preferences. Also collaborating closely with the client to understand their business objectives and goals for the system. Based on this research,  user stories were created to capture the user's requirements and needs.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I prioritize client and user needs when designing software. Interviews, surveys, and observation help me to understand and plan with those needs taken into consideration. User stories describe the user's goals and how the software will help them achieve them after gathering user requirements. User stories help the development team understand user needs and collaborate.
